# Miniflux Plugin for KOReader

A KOReader plugin that lets you read RSS entries from a [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) server on your e-reader, online or offline.

**Releases:** [zanderp/miniflux.koplugin](https://github.com/zanderp/miniflux.koplugin/releases)

## Features

### Reading & HTML viewer

- **Browse**: Feeds, categories, unread, **starred** (bookmarks), and **search** entries from your Miniflux server.
- **Read**: Download entries (with optional images) for offline reading, or use the **HTML reader** setting to open articles in-app without saving.
- **HTML viewer**: In-app reader with reflow to screen width, mobile User-Agent for readable layouts, and print-version request when supported. Works on all devices including Kindle.
  - **Exit**: Tap **top right** to close the viewer.
  - **Scroll**: Vertical slide on the screen to scroll the page.
  - **Zoom**: Horizontal panning on the screen to zoom in/out (and adjust font size).
  - **Navigation menu**: Scroll all the way to the **bottom** of the article to see the end-of-entry menu: **⌂ Return to Miniflux**, next/previous entry, bookmark, delete, etc.
- **Links in downloaded entries**: Tap a link in a downloaded entry → link dialog with **Open in HTML viewer** (e.g. on Kindle/Kobo/PocketBook), **Open in browser** (where supported), and **Open image in viewer** for image links. Follow links without leaving the plugin.
- **Navigation in HTML viewer**: Use the menu at the bottom (see above). **⌂ Return to Miniflux** closes the viewer and returns you to the same list (listing refreshes so read/starred state is visible). In the normal (downloaded) viewer, **Close** opens the KOReader home folder. **← Previous** and **Next →** use the same auto-delete rule: the entry you leave is deleted only if the setting is on, it’s read, and it’s not bookmarked (deletion happens after navigation so the next article opens correctly).

### Status, storage & sync

- **Status & bookmarks**: Mark read/unread; **star/unstar** entries (Miniflux bookmark API). Sync runs when online. **Mark as read on open** (optional).
- **Storage**: Custom **download location** (pick or create a folder). Delete single or selected entries, **clear all** downloaded entries. **Auto-delete read on close** removes the local copy when you leave a read entry (Close, Return to Miniflux then X, or ← Previous / Next →). **Bookmarked (starred) entries are never auto-deleted**; if you tap **★ Toggle bookmark** in the dialog, that entry is not removed when you leave. **Remove from history when deleting** (optional); bulk delete and auto-delete on close always clean KOReader history so you don’t see “entry.html (deleted)”.
- **E-ink**: Optional image proxy for e-ink-friendly scaling. **Reliable close**: When you leave the reader and press **X**, the plugin and browser close in one step with a full repaint so you don’t get a stuck screen.
- **More**: Prefetch next N entries (Unread or Starred), image recovery (re-download missing images), delete by date range, storage info, delete all images (keep text). Settings persist (HTML reader, auto-delete on close, etc.).

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/zanderp/miniflux.koplugin/releases/latest) (e.g. `miniflux.koplugin-0.0.17.zip`).
2. Unzip and copy the **miniflux.koplugin** folder into KOReader’s plugin directory.
3. Enable the plugin in KOReader.

## Usage

1. **Settings** (Miniflux → Settings): Set server URL and API token. Optionally set download location, entries limit, sort order, mark-as-read on open, auto-delete read on close, HTML reader, remove from history when deleting, and clear all downloads.
2. **Read entries**: Open “Read entries” to see Unread, Starred, Feeds, Categories, Search, and Local (downloaded).
3. **Search**: Use “Search” from the main list, enter a term, and open results from the Miniflux API.
4. **Starred**: Open “Starred” to see bookmarked entries. Use “★ Toggle bookmark” in the end-of-entry dialog to star/unstar.
5. **Download**: Tap an entry to download and open it. Long-press to enter selection mode and batch download.
6. **HTML viewer gestures**: **Tap top right** to exit. **Vertical slide** to scroll; **horizontal pan** to zoom. Scroll to the **bottom** for the navigation menu (Return to Miniflux, next/previous, etc.). In the **normal** (downloaded) viewer, “Close” opens the KOReader home folder; use Back/Home to leave the reader.
7. **Storage** (Settings): **Storage info** shows entry count, total size, image count/size. **Delete by date range** (1 week / 1 month / 3 months / 6 months), **Delete all images (keep text)**, **Image recovery** (re-download missing images).
8. **Prefetch** (Settings → Prefetch next entries): Set count (0–5), then “From Unread” or “From Starred” to download the next N undownloaded entries.

  - [x] **Remove from history when deleting** (optional; bulk delete and auto-delete on close always clean history)
  - [x] **Return to Miniflux in normal (downloaded) mode** — When you opened from the plugin, the end-of-entry dialog shows **⌂ Return to Miniflux** (closes reader, returns to the same list, and refreshes it so read/starred state is visible) and **Close** (opens KOReader home). When opened from file manager, only Close and Cancel.
  - [x] **Bookmarked entries never auto-deleted** — Starred entries are never removed by auto-delete. If you tap **★ Toggle bookmark** in the dialog, that entry is not auto-deleted when you use Close, Return to Miniflux, or ← Previous / Next →.
  - [x] **Previous / Next and auto-delete** — **← Previous** and **Next →** use the same rule: the entry you leave is deleted (and removed from history) only if the setting is on, the entry is read, and it’s not bookmarked. Deletion runs after navigation so the next/previous article opens correctly.

## Technical Details

- **API**: Uses Miniflux REST API (entries, feeds, categories, bookmark toggle, search).
- **Modular layout**: API layer, domains (entries, feeds, categories), browser UI, reader integration.
- **Offline-first**: Works without network for downloaded entries; status and bookmark changes sync when online.

## Development

### Nix (recommended)

```bash
direnv allow   # or: nix develop
# Tools: lua, selene, stylua, task

cargo install stylua selene
```

### Commands

```bash
task check     # Lint and check
